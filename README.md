## 🌎 Main Project

- [**Dynamics of Seismic Regimes**](https://github.com/lucasofalonso/seismic-regime-dynamics)  

Uncovering global seismic patterns using Unsupervised Learning and Stochastic Processes. This project applies K-Means clustering on temporal feature spaces (entropy, energy, rate) to identify distinct planetary seismic states, validating them via Markov Chain analysis.
📊 Includes an [interactive 3D/MAP (2024 Case Study)](https://lucasofalonso.github.io/seismic-regime-dynamics/reports/clusters-map.html
). This generated example highlights the spatial projection of the "Critical Regime," showing how the Nazca subduction zone acted as a primary energetic driver for the Pacific Ring of Fire during that period.
